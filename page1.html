        <p>This visualization is included in an article about economic mobility in the United States, so the audience is people interested in that. It answers the question: how does economic mobility differ along racial/ethnic lines? It encodes cumulative years each family spent in each of five economic quintiles proportionate to the total number of years tracked times the total number of families. In other words, it encodes the average percentage of time a family spends in each quintile based on their race. The percentages of time (numerical data) are encoded by length of the bars. The quintiles (ordinal data) are encoded by color and ranked by position. The racial groups examined are encoded by position in parallel charts, and comparison across groups is facilitated by inclusion of the percentage numbers.Readers can identify the quintile that each racial group spends the most time in, on average, and compare the frequency of each quintile across racial groups. </p>
        <p>Without knowing where the data came from it is difficult to say whether this chart visualizes the truth of the average time families spent in each quintile. The visualization is functional in terms of displaying the data in a way that is easy to read and conveys a comparison of times families spent in each quintile based on race. The colors are appealing and make it easier to align each quintile between races. It is not elaborate but pleasing to the eye. This graphic does not give much detail about the data but does provoke some commentary on how race affects social economic status. It encourages readers to think about race as it relates to where families sit economically, which can lead to other enlightening conversations about race in society. This visualization is good because it is functional and provokes conversation about the relationship between race and economic status. It uses color and styling appropriately and in a way that is easy for readers to see and comprehend its message.

        <p>The audience of this visualization is anyone who is concerned with the success of the Toronto Raptors or who is interested in statistics about NBA teams in general. This Visualization uses hue to effectively convey wins and losses of each season for the Toronto Raptors since 1995. This visualization tells the story of the Toronto Raptors’ years of losses and few NBA championship games until recent years when they had more success and ultimately a winning NBA championship. Toronto Raptors’ wins and losses in each season, their wins and losses in NBA championships, and their general pattern of success is encoded in the visualization. The columns for the Playoffs makes it particularly clear to understand which seasons were the Raptors’ more successful years. The charts lined up on top of each other allow for the easy comparison of seasons and highlights the progression of the team’s winning abilities with little red in the early years and much more red towards the bottom of the visualization in more recent years. This visualization lets the reader understand the Raptor’s upward trend for winning over the course of their existence.
        </p>
        <p> In terms of the 5 factors, this visualization displays the truthful facts of the wins and losses of the Raptors from 1995-2019. It is functional in that it is clear to see the trends of wins and losses but more difficult to count wins and losses or see individual parts because the marks are so small and it is slightly overwhelming. The colors make red loss trends easy to see and the general look of the visualization matches the Toronto Raptors’ colors and logo which is appealing to fans. This visualization is useful for the audience to see the overall improvement of the Toronto Raptors. It delivers a clear message through the presentation of each year chronologically. It is not particularly enlightening as much as it is insightful and truthful. This visualization is good because it clearly presents the story of the Toronto Raptors from continuous losses to winning an NBA Championship.

        <p>This visualization shows the phasing out of baby boomers from the birth of the generation until the generation is almost gone. It encodes the data through contrasting colors, lengths of bars, and the movement of bars over time. The reader can see the progression of the age of baby boomers while also comparing the amount of women to men alive at each age for each year, which allows the viewer to gain additional knowledge about how the numbers change over time. This visualization is also good because it uses lighting effectively and the action is easy to follow to understand the message of the progression of the baby boomer generation, making it aesthetically pleasing to the eye. It effectively highlights the trend over time, although it does not allow for easy cross-referencing between non sequential years. Although the chart changes over time, the axes remain constant, which avoids distortion. There’s minimal ink that does not convey information (no axes, no grid, white space).

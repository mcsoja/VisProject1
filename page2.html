        <p>The message this visualization seems to convey is that Baby Boomers see themselves as having strengths. Contextually, it probably is intended to rebut those who view elderly people as lacking competency. It encodes data about the percentage of surveyed Baby Boomers who describe themselves using five terms. The numerical data is encoded by area, and the categories by color (hue). This visualization lacks truthfulness, as it obscures the underlying data. For instance, we only see positive categories. According to this chart, 22% of Boomers describe themselves as tech-savvy. But how many describe themselves as technically challenged? We don’t know. It further lacks functionality; comparison of the five attributes is difficult because the percentages that make up the “Baby Boomer’s” body do not add up to 100%. This confuses the reader about what the percentages mean since they seem to represent parts of the whole body. Even if the percentages added up to 100%, the use of the body as somewhat of a pie chart is not functional because it makes comparing the varying areas of color difficult to compare because they’re all different shapes. There is also no ordering to numbers, nor do the areas match the numbers— 78% seems to map to fewer pixels than 61%. </p>

        <p> This visualization demonstrates the quantity of Apples Bananas, Oranges, and Lemons in months January-April and shows the audience the changes over time. It is meant to provide information into the possible trends of fruit over the period of 4 months. 
          It is very difficult to dissect information from this graph due to the lack of information. 
          This visualization is also not functional because it does not provide enough context for the read to understand the message of the graphic. There is no title and the y-axis has no units. This leaves the reader completely confused as to what this chart is trying to convey about the different fruits. Additionally, since the lemons category hides the values for February and March, the graph lacks truth. This flaw in the graph makes it difficult to compare the bars to each other and more difficult to draw conclusions and insights from.

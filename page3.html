        <p>The visualization seems to be targeting the general public to inform them of the severity of the temperatures of heatwaves in Europe. It also seems to be encouraging the reader to understand where the places of Europe experienced the harshest heat. While it demonstrates that the most affected areas of Europe are in the middle/south of Europe, it does not draw many insights on why we should care about these temperatures. The data is mainly encoded through the use of color, as a continuous ordered value. This is also inappropriate: as discussed in class, changes in hue do not translate to accurate human perception of the underlying numerical change unless explicitly stated. 
          One of the important facets of a good data visualization is for it to be aesthetically pleasing. In this visualization, the temperatures displayed on the map are cluttered and have way too many numbers on top of the map, making it overwhelming and difficult to read and understand. This decreases the effectiveness of the visualization. Additionally, this map is attended for general audiences to examine the temperatures during the heatwave in Europe and does not allow for the intended audience to easily extract insights. It requires the audience to do much more work to examine the information on the visualization. It is also difficult to discern what parts of the map each number represents since there are only borders for countries. There is also no context and therefore the reader is unsure what point the designer is trying to get across with this visualization. Perhaps in additional improvements of this visualization, it would be useful to build a more insightful visualization by showing the temperature of the heat waves in Europe over past years, which could do a better job in demonstrating the harms of climate change over time.

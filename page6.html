        <p>This redesign took the original bar chart and converted it into a line graph. This line graph uses points to highlight the quantity of fruit for each month and connects these points to demonstrate a correlation/trends throughout these months. In the previous design, values for lemons were hidden, which made the graph not completely truthful and transparent. In this case, all the values are clearly presented and transparent, allowing the audience to clearly understand the quantity of fruit in each given time frame. The connected lines and points in the graph also allow for the audience to identify trends in the data - and as a result, draw insights and knowledge more easily than the previous design. Line graphs do a good job in comparing and contrasting the different fruits over time together. Both a line and bar graph are useful in demonstrating changes over short periods of time (in this case, 4 months). However, a bar graph can be more helpful in visualizing the differences between the quantities of fruit in a single month. We were willing to make this tradeoff by using a line graph instead as it would be more beneficial to the viewer to understand trends with the different fruits over a period of time, rather than examining the differences in a singular month.</p>

      <p>In this new visualization, we used a bubble chart. This was used to depict the relationships between the quantitative percentage values for each adjective Baby Boomers used to describe themselves. 
        The redesign tackles 2 main improvements in what constitutes as a good visualization from the original chart. It is aesthetically pleasing, using simple shapes and clearly defined categories. It is also now functional as it now helps our audience interpret the information correctly. 
        This redesign does not make the reader assume that the different categories are parts of a whole like the original. The original makes it look like baby boomers were separated into individual categories, meaning one person could not be in more than one at a time. This would be assumed because the different color blocks all make up one person, but the percentages associated with each block do not correspond to the amount of the person they cover. Our redesign also allows for easier comparison of sizes between categories. The original makes it hard to compare sizes with different shapes of each block of color. Our redesign contains all circular units for each category which is easier for the reader to compare.
        We traded off some beauty for functionality in the redesign. While the person figure was eye-catching, it did not represent the message correctly. Our redesign is much simpler and less eye catching, but it allows the general message of how baby boomers categorize themselves to be more easily identified.

    <p> This redesign explains the range of temperatures on a color legend with a hue to represent different temperature ranges. It also labels which regions are tied to which temperature ranges and their geographical locations in relation to other countries in europe. It more clearly communicates how temperature varies based on geographic location and ties in specific country names for reference. Our design also includes a more detailed description of what each color represents on the legend. Our redesign is a much different shape than the original. The original used a full map of Europe and listed temperatures for undescribed places whereas our redesign does not show a map and lists temperatures based on region and country. This redesign is much easier to read compared to the original. The original visualization was difficult to read because there were so many temperatures listed. It was difficult to discern any patterns other than from using color patterns to detect temperature changes in the original. Our redesign allows for readers to make the connection between geographic location and temperature much more easily. It is much clearer and does not require the reader to read a ton of data points to understand the trends. We traded the geographical representation of the map for ease of comprehension on the part of the reader. While it is not as easy to physically see the temperatures tied to each region, the reader can easily infer this information and recognize trends quicker than on the original. </p>
